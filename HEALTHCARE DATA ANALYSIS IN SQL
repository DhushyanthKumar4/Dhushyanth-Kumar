PROBLEMS:
1. Patient Demographics
•	Question 1: What is the distribution of patients by gender?
(Count the number of male and female patients in the patients table.)
2. Patient Age Calculation
•	Question 2: What is the average age of the patients in the dataset?
(Calculate the age of each patient based on the dob and find the average age.)
3. Appointment Status Analysis
•	Question 3: What is the appointment status distribution across all appointments?
(Group appointments by status and count the occurrences of each status: Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled.)
4. Doctor Appointment Count
•	Question 4: How many appointments has each doctor had?
(Count the number of appointments for each doctor by doctor_id in the appointments table.)
5. Canceled Appointments
•	Question 5: How many appointments have been canceled?
(Filter the appointments where status = 'Cancelled' and count the total number of such appointments.)
6. Upcoming Appointments
•	Question 6: How many appointments are scheduled for the next 30 days from today?
(Use the appointment_date and filter appointments where the date is within the next 30 days, then count them.)
7. Patients with Recent Appointments
•	Question 7: How many patients have had an appointment in the last 6 months?
(Filter appointments that occurred in the last 6 months and count distinct patient_id.)
8. Doctors with Completed Appointments
•	Question 8: Which doctor has had the highest number of completed appointments?
(Group appointments by doctor_id and status, filter for Completed appointments, and order by the count to find the doctor with the highest number of completed appointments.)
9. Appointment Cancellation Rate by Doctor
•	Question 9: What is the cancellation rate of appointments for each doctor?
(For each doctor, calculate the percentage of canceled appointments compared to the total appointments they have had.)
10. Patient Admission Trend
•	Question 10: How many patients were admitted each month over the last 6 months?
(Group by the month and year of admission_date and count the number of distinct patients admitted in each month.)
